    "paragraph3": "The establishment of this company in the heart of East Java provides abundant benefits to the community, both from within the city of Surabaya and Gresik, Mojokerto, and so on. So, what's in MASPION IT? Well, Gen-Z pals must be wondering right, how can out-of-towners stop by to pamper their eyes in Surabaya.",
    "paragraph4": "FYI, Gen-Z friends, it turns out that MASPION IT is an IT business center or one of the largest tool manufacturers in Indonesia, you know! The company, which was founded and led by Alim Markus as President Director of Maspion Group since 1970, ",

    "paragraph3": "Gen-Z, if we look deeper, it is not only the economic storm that came crashing down on the President Director of Maspion Group. However, it is also about choosing the right name before the formation of the word 'MASPION IT'. Long before the name was legalized, Alim Markus gave the name of his company as 'MASPIONEER' which if interpreted will be split into 2 parts, namely 'MAS' with the meaning of gold, and 'PIONEER' which means the first creator.",
    "paragraph4": "Unfortunately, the name 'MASPIONEER' was blatantly rejected by Panji Witjaksana as a person who played an important role as a representative of the Japanese Electronics Company called 'Pioneer'. Therefore, Alim Markus finally decided to use the name 'MASPION IT' alone as the name of his company which is still operating smoothly and gaining recognition in the industry as a quality and reliable manufacturer."

So, Information and Communication Technology does contain a broad sense, namely all activities related to processing, manipulating, managing, transferring information between media. The occurrence of the development of electronic technology, or it can be said as the forerunner of ICT today, had its golden moment in the Cold War era. Science and technology competition between the Western bloc (the United States) and the Eastern bloc (formerly the Soviet Union) spurred the development of electronic technology through efforts to miniaturize electronic circuits for controlling spacecraft and war machines. The digitization of telecommunications devices then converged with computer devices, which from the beginning were devices that adopted digital technology.",
