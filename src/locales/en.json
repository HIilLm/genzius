    "paragraph1": "MASPION IS THE ANSWER!",
    "paragraph2": "Surabaya City is the largest metropolitan city in East Java Province. With this nickname, it certainly does not escape the supporting factors possessed by the City of Heroes. One of them is the operation of a large company named 'Maspioneer', or what is now known as MASPION IT.",
    "paragraph3": "The establishment of this company in the heart of East Java provides abundant benefits to the community, both from within the city of Surabaya and Gresik, Mojokerto, and so on. So, what's in MASPION IT? Well, Gen-Z pals must be wondering right, how can out-of-towners stop by to pamper their eyes in Surabaya.",
    "paragraph4": "FYI, Gen-Z friends, it turns out that MASPION IT is an IT business center or one of the largest tool manufacturers in Indonesia, you know! The company, which was founded and led by Alim Markus as President Director of Maspion Group since 1970, ",
    "paragraph5": "also has strong expertise in marketing, manufacturing various series of household appliances products, and even entering into the sale of laptops, PCs, computers.",
    "paragraph6": "The father of Maspion Group President Director Alim Husin has overcome many obstacles to establish a company that he would manage himself.

    "paragraph3": "Gen-Z, if we look deeper, it is not only the economic storm that came crashing down on the President Director of Maspion Group. However, it is also about choosing the right name before the formation of the word 'MASPION IT'. Long before the name was legalized, Alim Markus gave the name of his company as 'MASPIONEER' which if interpreted will be split into 2 parts, namely 'MAS' with the meaning of gold, and 'PIONEER' which means the first creator.",
    "paragraph4": "Unfortunately, the name 'MASPIONEER' was blatantly rejected by Panji Witjaksana as a person who played an important role as a representative of the Japanese Electronics Company called 'Pioneer'. Therefore, Alim Markus finally decided to use the name 'MASPION IT' alone as the name of his company which is still operating smoothly and gaining recognition in the industry as a quality and reliable manufacturer."

    "paragraph1": "After overcoming challenging obstacles, MASPION GROUP succeeded in establishing a company engaged in banking, named BANK MASPION.

Pujiono Santoso has had a 24-year career at Bank CIMB Niaga and held various management positions, and obtained a Master of Management degree from STIE Perbanas, Surabaya in 2009.",

Fun fact, Gen-Z friends, UBAYA POLITEKNIK has won the Excellent Campus Award as the Best Vocational College in East Java since 2015-2022. Awards that cannot be achieved by any agency, become a branding of UBAYA POLITEKNIK that they are indeed a quality college, totality so that it becomes an undeniable factor that this campus is indeed of high standard, but still affordable for the cost of coaching.",
    "paragraph4": "As time goes by, more and more efforts are being made to keep up with the dynamics of community development in the era of globalization. Apart from that, there is also a goal to prepare graduates to be able to contribute maximally, achieving excellence, so it is felt that professional higher education is needed. That is one of the reasons, the establishment of UBAYA POLITEKNIK which began with 3 Study Programs, namely: Accounting, Marketing Management and Secretarial in the academic year 2000-2001, and in accordance with the Decree of the Minister of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia Number 23/D/0/1998 dated April 16, 1998."

    "paragraph2": "SHARING INFORMATION",
    "paragraph3": "Gen-Z friends, Information and Communication Technology or commonly abbreviated as ICT includes two aspects with different meanings, namely information technology and communication technology.",
    "paragraph4": "The Information Technology part itself includes everything related to the process, use as a tool, manipulation, and management of information. While Communication Technology is everything related to the use of tools to process and transfer data from one device to another.",
    "paragraph5": "Therefore, Gen-Z pals, if we draw conclusions about these 2 aspects, namely, information technology and communication technology are two inseparable concepts. So, Information and Communication Technology does contain a broad sense, namely all activities related to processing, manipulating, managing, transferring information between media. The occurrence of the development of electronic technology, or it can be said as the forerunner of ICT today, had its golden moment in the Cold War era. Science and technology competition between the Western bloc (the United States) and the Eastern bloc (formerly the Soviet Union) spurred the development of electronic technology through efforts to miniaturize electronic circuits for controlling spacecraft and war machines. The digitization of telecommunications devices then converged with computer devices, which from the beginning were devices that adopted digital technology.",
    "paragraph6": "Changes or advances in information and communication technology can also be through Internet-based learning that can allow synchronous learning with the main advantage that learners and facilitators do not have to be in the same place. If we draw a line to be an example, the creation of this digital magazine is one form of the advancement of Information and Communication Technology as a means of gathering information to be enjoyed by readers in an anti-complicated way, but still get the latest updates on any events that occur."

    "paragraph2": "The COVID-19 pandemic has forced people around the world to suspend their activities for an indefinite period of time. This is clearly detrimental to many parties, ranging from companies, schools, employees, to the impact on the existing learning system. Activities that used to run normally without obstacles, restrictions or regulations, have changed drastically to become more limited due to the COVID-19 Virus.",
    "paragraph3": "Since the beginning of 2020, when all the media revealed information about the spread of this virus, that's when the world's silence began. Many things that can improve quality but are blocked by the pandemic, which ultimately become limited to do. Apart from that, it is impossible for us to just enjoy, dissolve, and be downcast with the existing situation. Some young people started brainstorming with the aim of not dying silly due to the events that made them move limited.",
    "paragraph4": "Many things are done online as evidence of waking up from the silence and narrow space to move during the COVID-19 Pandemic. It can be started with distance learning through zoom, meetings through google meet and other efforts that are transparent evidence of the rise of our movement little by little from the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic."

    "paragraph1": "THE AWAKENING DAY",
    "paragraph2": "The easing of the COVID-19 Pandemic certainly makes most humans breathe with relief, feeling free from the strangulation of the narrow space that existed during the COVID-19 Pandemic. As discussed earlier, the event made most of the population on this earth feel traumatized by the impact that occurred and hit them.",
    "paragraph3": "Hearing the news that we can be a little free and released from the pressure during the virus, is an opportunity to start fixing everything, or you could say the same as what is done by an organization in one of the places to study in Surabaya. Gen-Z friends, working not only with a painting, but also through an action that is enough evidence to be judged by an agency or person with extraordinary appreciation, special, and not pent up to continue working.",
    "paragraph4": "Maspion IT decided to rise from its silence due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. MADIG COMPETITION was held face-to-face in 2020, and in the following year of course the company led by Alim Marcus had the desire to hold it again, but was hindered by the COVID-19 Pandemic.",
    "paragraph5": "But now, MADIG COMPETITION can be held again after 2 years of pent-up due to the event. It is a form that after the subsiding or almost disappearance of the COVID-19 Pandemic, it has created many new movements and even provided opportunities for the public to move, work, and innovate again."

    "paragraph1": "SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya, or commonly referred to by the slang nickname 'SEMKANISA', is a state vocational high school located at Jl. Smea no 4, Surabaya. Every school, with different majors, has its own advantages without question. Established in 1950, the school on Jl. Smea is the oldest school in Surabaya, which managed to obtain state status under the name SMEA Negeri Surabaya (without majors). This prefix certainly did not stop our great leaders from maintaining the presence of SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya.",
    "paragraph2t": "SEMKANISA comes with 8 different majors that are also equipped with Teaching Factory for each department as needed. We have a question from our Gen-Z friends, which is special for the GENZIUS Team! How great is SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya, until it can stand that long?",
    "paragraph2": "An interesting question to be answered in detail, hehehe. FYI, Gen-Z friends, if we look back to answer that question, SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya managed to have an honorable collaboration with MEMORANDUM, a print and online news portal. The collaboration took place in commemoration of MEMORANDUM's 53rd Anniversary and was attended by several officials, such as the Regent of Malang, the Chief Prosecutor of Mojokerto, and so on.",
    "paragraph3t": "Not only that advantage, Gen-Z Friend! SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya also had the opportunity to witness the launching of MEMORANDUM TV on that day. Some selected students as representatives became part of the implementation of this collaboration. The school, which was established in 1950, contributes through the field of one of its majors, namely Television Program Broadcast Production. As students of the department, they broke down several parts to carry out their duties. Starting from the cameraman, streamer, reporter, to the part that organizes Vmix and the documentation section. ",
    "paragraph3": "The cooperation made SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya honored, as well as proud and emotional, because it is like being able to help many people with the advantages possessed by SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya and also made it into the MEMORANDUM newspaper Special Anniversary Edition with 72 pages. The school, which contains 8 departments, has an extraordinary vision and mission to carry out.

    "paragraph2": "The two events were successfully held, which made many people admire the efforts made by MPK-OSIS SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya. The school also of course always gives wholehearted support to its beloved children who always try to make the school proud. With these two events, it can be a proof that the limited activities due to the pandemic do not die every time.",
    "paragraph3t": "Giving the title 'The Awakening Day' is certainly full of consideration of the various meanings and philosophies of the chosen theme. MPK-OSIS SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya decided to use the tittle, with the intention of informing the entire public of the awakening achievements made by the students of SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya, represented by MPK-OSIS SMK Negeri 1 Surabaya.
